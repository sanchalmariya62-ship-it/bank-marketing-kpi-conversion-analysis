# Bank Marketing KPI Dashboard & Customer Conversion Prediction

## Objective
To support Marketing and Sales teams in a banking context by identifying
high-potential customers and monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs)
using data analytics and predictive modeling.
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Conversion Rate: Percentage of contacted customers who subscribed to a term deposit
- Contact Efficiency: Average number of calls per successful subscription
- Campaign Success Rate: Conversion rate by contact channel (cellular, telephone)
- Monthly Conversion Trend: Subscription rate over time


## Business Problem
Marketing campaigns are costly and inefficient when customers are contacted
randomly. This project aims to improve decision-making by combining KPI
monitoring with customer conversion prediction.

## Tech Stack
